# BOJ algorithm problems solutions

This repository aggregates the solutions that I posted on [BOJ acmicpc.net](https://www.acmicpc.net/)

Primarily using C++, but I use Python and Rust occasionally.

## Levels 
Currently solving level 44 / 53 (DP4)

For more details: [BOJ levels](https://www.acmicpc.net/step)

## Future plans
Solve levels on [solved.ac](https://solved.ac/en/class) 

Get Rusty!!
